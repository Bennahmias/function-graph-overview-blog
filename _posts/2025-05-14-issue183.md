## Issue Description

Nested Function Graph Navigation [#Issue 183](https://github.com/tmr232/function-graph-overview/issues/183)


We would like to enhance the user experience by adding support for navigating between function graphs within the code visualization. Currently, nested functions appear as regular blocks with no distinction or interaction.
With this feature, function nodes in the graph will be uniquely colored to indicate their special status.
Clicking such a node will jump the cursor to the corresponding function in the editor per project and not only inside the same file.
Automatically updating the graph to display it. Additionally, a Back button will allow users to return to the previous function graph they navigated from
